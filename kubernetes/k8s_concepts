Pod
- pod is smallest unit in k8s
- Container is running image. Container runs inside pod. when user load is increased a new container is created in a new pod.
- If a dependency container needs to be run in parallel to main container then its creased in same pod (like, sidecar)

Commands:
kubectl get pods -? get all pods
kubectl get pods -o wide -> gives extra information of pods
kubectl describe pod NAME -> details information of pod

Controller:
-Replication Controller - Helps to run more than one pod, ensure specified no of pods are running, scale in scale out
-ReplicationController(old version) will be ReplicaSet(new version)
-ReplicaSet can manage existing containers created outside replicaset
-replica count can be changed later by updating replicaset file or from command line by proving file name for replicaSet name as command line parameter

Commands
kubectl create -f replication_controller.yaml -> will create replication controller along with pods
kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml -> will create replicaset along with pods
kubectl replace -f replicaset.yaml -> will apply updated definition (create more pods if replica count changed)
kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset.yaml ->creates new pods
kubectl scale --replicas=6 replicaset replicaset_name ->creates new pods
