Container Orchestration Tools
Docker Swarm - Easy to setup but have basic features
Kubernetes - Medium difficulty. Supports many features. Supported on cloud platforms Azure, AWS, GCP
MESOS - Provide complex features. Difficult to setup


Cluster
- Set of nodes(Master + nodes)
- Master - responsible of managing nodes

Components
1. API server - Front end of K8s
2. etcd(key value store) - store configuration information. Master node stores information shared by kubelet.
3. Scheduler - Distribute load across nodes
4. Controller - Brain of system. take care of creating/removing resource(scale in/scale out). or replace bad resource.
5. Kubelet - Agent installed on node. Ensures containers are running as expected. It shares information with master node.
6. Container Runtime - Underlying software usd to run container(E.g. Docker)

Kubectl (command-line tool)
- Used to deploy and manage application in Kubernetes cluster.(deploy node, get nodes)
- Communicate with a Kubernetes cluster's control plane, using the Kubernetes API.

kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
-command -> get, create, delete
-Type -> Pod, Service
-Name -> resource name

-kubectl run hello-minikube -> deploy application
-kubectl cluster-info -> get information of cluster
-kubectl get nodes -> nodes running on cluster
